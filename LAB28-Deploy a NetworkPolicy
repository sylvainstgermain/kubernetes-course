Create a network policy to stop all intrapod communication.
Create a network policy that allows a front-end pod to communicate with a back-end pod.

Network Policies help to give a Kubernetes Administrator control over 
the intricate Pod intranetworking. This is incredibly useful in assuring 
that your cluster is secure and cannot be attacked
