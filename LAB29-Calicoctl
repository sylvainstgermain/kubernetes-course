#irst, we will define a Deployment named sise-deploy. We are doing this 
#in order to have a target to use while we are testing our routing. 
#This ultimately will be an endpoint for the service that we define 
#in the next step.

#You may already have a file with the same name but different data. If so,
 vim your file, then delete the data with the following keyboard strokes.
 # First run dShiftg. Then run dgg to delete everything from your cursor 
 #to the top.

 #Note that the simpleservice container is designed as a testing container, 
 #and has the following paths available to retrieve information 
 #from: /health, /info, and /env.

#Next, let's create a manifest for a Service that will select all the pods 
#inside of our sise-deploy deployment via their label app: sise. Once running,
# we will be able to target this simpleservice and observe how it is acting 
#via the command calicoctl.
