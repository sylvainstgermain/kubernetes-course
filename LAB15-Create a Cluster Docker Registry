We will run a docker registry in the cluster and use a special 
repo prefix such as "127.0.0.1:30500" to match both the 
port-forwarded pushing of images into the registry and the 
nodes' pulling of new images for running on the cluster.

Kubernetes uses Docker Registries to pull images in order to 
build out the containers inside of Pods. By default, Kubernetes
 is going to pull images from dockerhub, however, it is possible 
 to get images pulled down from other trusted registries.
