Tainted Nodes and Tolerations
Lab Objective
Understand Tainted Nodes and Tolerations
Configure Nodes to allow Pods to use Node Selectors
Manually schedule a Pod without a Scheduler
Tainted food smells bad, and you know to avoid it. However, there are certain times that you, being the unique individual that you are, like eating something that is generally considered "tainted". One example is Blue Cheese. Some people have a toleration for it, other people ask to move down a few chairs if their friend has some with their dinner.

It works in very much the same way for Pods and Nodes. Think of Pods as people, and Nodes as dinner plates that have Blue Cheese (or some other food that might offend your nostrils). The nodes can be tainted, which will make all Pods avoid being scheduled on that node. That is, unless a Pod (or Pod Template) chooses to have a toleration that allows them to use the tainted node.

Procedure


#To begin, let's create a simple nginx Deployment that has 10 replicas.
vim tnt01.yaml￼
￼
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx
  labels:
    env: test
spec:
  replicas: 10
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      tolerable: yep
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        tolerable: yep
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent

#Go ahead and create that Deployment now.
kubectl apply -f objets-cours/tnt01.yaml￼
deployment.apps/nginx created

#Now let's see what Nodes each of the Pods were scheduled on.
kubectl get pods -o wide￼

You should notice that they are fairly evenly distributed across all three 
of your nodes.

#Let's delete this Deployment so we can see how it behaves after there has 
#been a taint applied.
kubectl delete -f objets-cours/tnt01.yaml￼
deployment.apps "nginx" deleted

# Now, let's taint node-1. The taint we will use here is NoSchedule. 
# And we will provide the key:value pair of trying_taints=yessir.
kubectl taint nodes node-1 trying_taints=yessir:NoSchedule￼
node/node-1 tainted

#Next we will create our simple Deployment again, and see where all of those 
#Pods get scheduled.
kubectl apply -f objets-cours/tnt01.yaml￼
deployment.apps/nginx created

#Check to see how the pods were distributed this time.
kubectl get pods -o wide￼

￼

#This time you should notice that the pods did not get s
#cheduled on node-1

# The taint made it so that the Pods all refused to be scheduled on node-1. 
# That certainly can be desireable for most Pods, but what about those that you want to be able to schedule on the tainted node? Simple, just include a toleration inside of the Pod spec.
vim tnt02.yaml￼

apiVersion: apps/v1

      - key: trying_taints
        value: yessir
        operator: "Equal"
        effect: "NoSchedule"

# Now we will create this new deployment.
kubectl apply -f objets-cours/tnt02.yaml￼
deployment.apps/nginx-tolerated created

# Next we can check to see where these pods were scheduled:
kubectl get pods -o wide￼

￼

#You should see that some of the Pods were allowed to be scheduled on node-1.
# The toleration worked, yay!

# Excellent! Now, let's remove both of the Deployments that we created.
kubectl delete deploy --all￼

￼
# Now that we have cleaned house, let's get rid of the taint that is 
# on node-1.
kubectl taint nodes node-1 trying_taints=yessir:NoSchedule-￼
node/node-1 untainted

#Let's verify that the first Deployment we created in this lab is now able 
#to schedule Pods on node-1.
kubectl apply -f tnt01.yaml￼
deployment.apps/nginx created

# Make sure there were some Pods scheduled on the node-1.
kubectl get pods -o wide￼

￼


#If there are any Pods scheduled on node-1 now, you have successfully 
# removed that taint!

# Delete this deployment again.
kubectl delete deploy --all￼
deployment.apps "nginx" deleted

# Instead of using taints for anti-affinity, let's now switch over to using 
# nodeSelectors. A nodeSelector allows us to specify a single or a group of
# Node(s) for the Pods to be scheduled on. The concept is rather simple after
# you fully understand labels. Simply label a node, and then use a 
# nodeSelector of that label inside of your Pod manifest. To start with, 
# let's label our node-2 with the label hd: ssd.
kubectl label node node-2 hd=ssd￼

# Now, let's create a Pod that uses a nodeSelector of hd: ssd.
vim node-selected.yaml￼

￼
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: node-selected
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx-node-selected
    image: nginx
  nodeSelector:
    hd: ssd

# And now let's apply it.
kubectl apply -f objets-cours/node-selected.yaml￼

#Next up, we will verify that it did get created on node-2.
kubectl get pods -o wide￼

￼

#The nodeSelector is great for getting specific types of Pods onto specific 
#types of nodes!

# If you are looking for even finer-grained control over where the Pod will 
# be scheduled, you can specify its spec.nodeName when creating it.
# Note: This is overriding the default Kubernetes Scheduler. Let's just 
# take a basic nginx pod, and schedule it specifically onto node-3.

vim no-scheduler.yaml￼

￼
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: no-sched
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx-no-sched
    image: nginx
  nodeName: node-3

#Now create that pod.
kubectl apply -f objets-cours/no-scheduler.yaml￼
pod/no-sched created

#And verify that it did land on node-3.
kubectl get pods -o wide￼

#Feel free to try to delete and create this pod again and again. 
# It will always land on node-3.
