Lab Objective
Wrap the application you have been working on into a Helm Chart so that you will be able to re-deploy it quickly whenever an update needs pushed.
You have gone through a ton or work these past few days to learn how to administer and develop applications with a Kubernetes cloud that provides high availability and low resource utilization.

Procedure

#Create a new chart called webby-chart with Helm.

helm create webby-chart
Creating webby-chart

#Remove all of the current templates.
rm -rf ~/webby-chart/templates/*

# Copy your composite deployment manifest into the templates directory.
cp webby-nginx-combo.yaml ~/webby-chart/templates/

# Next, let's export the webby-keys secret into the templates directory.
kubectl get secrets webby-keys -o yaml > ~/webby-chart/templates/webby-keys.yaml

# Now we have to get all of our ConfigMaps exported into the templates 
# directory as well. First ensure you have the index-file
kubectl get cm index-file -o yaml > ~/webby-chart/templates/index-file.yaml

# Great! Now ensure you have the nginx-conf
kubectl get cm nginx-conf -o yaml > ~/webby-chart/templates/nginx-conf.yaml

# Finally, dump a copy of the configMap nginx-txt
kubectl get cm nginx-txt -o yaml > ~/webby-chart/templates/nginx-txt.yaml

# Now we need to make sure that we have this chart working properly. To do so,
# let's clean out our cluster and start over again with Helm. First, delete
# all of the ConfigMaps.
kubectl delete cm --all

# Next, delete a deployment.
kubectl delete deploy nginx-webby

# Finally, delete the webby-keys secret.
#Note: DO NOT delete all secrets
kubectl delete secret webby-keys
secret "webby-keys" deleted

# Verify that there are no Pods, Deployments, or ConfigMaps running. If so,
# delete them. (You may likely have random pods from previous labs running 
# still).
kubectl get pods,deploy,cm

# Now is the moment you have been waiting for. It is time to deploy your 
# Chart with Helm and verify that it is working.
helm install ./webby-chart --generate-name

NAME: webby-chart-1587003842
LAST DEPLOYED: Wed Apr 15 22:24:03 2020
NAMESPACE: default
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
TEST SUITE: None        

# Let's check out the pods that are now running from the helm deployment. 
# Pretty cool, huh!?
kubectl get pods
NAME                                 READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
nginx-webby-combo-7f74d6c7df-2vmdh   0/3     ContainerCreating   0          9s
nginx-webby-combo-7f74d6c7df-mkbpd   0/3     ContainerCreating   0          9s
nginx-webby-combo-7f74d6c7df-ssflf   0/3     ContainerCreating   0          9s

# Verify that you can access the website by port-forwarding one of the pods 
# and curling your localhost.
sudo kubectl port-forward <FULL_POD_NAME> 80:80
sudo kubectl port-forward nginx-webby-combo-7f74d6c7df-2vmdh 2224:80


curl 127.0.0.1:2224

Awesome! Great job! Now package up your chart so that you have it recorded somewhere nice and neat.

student@bchd:~$ helm package webby-chart


Successfully packaged chart and saved it to: /home/student/webby-chart-0.1.0.tgz
Helm will default to adding this new chart to a local repository. Since we have Tiller running, the way to install this chart again would be to run helm install local/webby-chart-0.1.0.tgz

The following lab is intended to be used as practice for after the class is complete, or for those students who have found themselves ahead of the rest of the class.
