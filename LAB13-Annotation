#Create a new Pod Manifest called ~/nginx-annot.yaml

vim ~/nginx-annot.yaml

---
apiVersion: v1          # API version (endpoint) to use
kind: Pod               # this is the resource to create
metadata:
  name: nginx-annot     # this is the name of the kubernetes resource
  annotations:          # this is an annotation
    alta3.com/logo-url: "https://static.alta3.com/images/Alta3-logo_large.png"      
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx         # name of the container
    image: nginx:1.18.0  # image and version of image to use
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80

#CHALLENGE 01 (REQUIRED) - Deploy the Pod using 
kubectl and verify that it is running.

kubectl create -f nginx-annot.yaml
kubectl get pods

#CHALLENGE 02 (REQUIRED) - Verify the annotation using kubectl.
kubectl describe pod nginx-annot | grep Annotations

If you decided to add another annotation to your manifest and ran
 the above command again, you will not see the second annotation 
 on the list because the term "Annotations" which you are grepping 
 for only exists once in the description of the pod. Instead you 
 will run the same command with an added flag, -A 1 to get and 
 additional line after the initial match on "Annotations". 
 Command would look like so. 
 kubectl describe pod nginx-annot | grep -A 1 Annotations
 . You can increase that number the more annotations you have.
