Lab Objective
CKAD Objective
Understand Multi-Container Pod design patterns (e.g. ambassador, adapter, sidecar)
Lab Objective
Build a composite pod
In this lab you'll learn to deploy two composite pods (pods with multiple containers).

The first answers the question, Whats a simple method for tracking network traffic within a Pod?". To capture traffic inside our pod, we'll deploy a second container within our pod running TCPdump. This technique can be applied to almost any pod deployment for capturing traffic.

The second combines our "webby" container with an "nginx" container. In subsequent labs, we'll include a 3rd container in this pod arrangement to augment our website with a blogging service.

kubectl apply -f objets-cours/netgrabber.yam

#Attach to the container tcpdumper (-c tcpdumper) within the pod netgrab (netgrab). After you run this command, the screen will say something like, Press ENTER if you don't see a command prompt. Disregard this message as it is a bit misleading.
kubectl attach netgrab -c tcpdumper

#Connect via a shell (-- sh) to the container busybox (-c busybox) within the pod netgrab (-it netgrab).
kubectl exec -it netgrab -c busybox -- sh
ping 8.8.8.8 -c 10
exit

#Notice that the container tcpdumper is displaying the traffic produced by the pod. 
#Let's clean up this experiment. Exit the busybox image

#Stop the pod netgrab
