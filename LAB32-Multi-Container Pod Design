Lab Objective
CKAD Objective
Understand Multi-Container Pod design patterns (e.g. ambassador, adapter, sidecar)
Lab Objective
Build a composite pod
In this lab you'll learn to deploy two composite pods (pods with multiple containers).

The first answers the question, Whats a simple method for tracking network traffic within a Pod?". To capture traffic inside our pod, we'll deploy a second container within our pod running TCPdump. This technique can be applied to almost any pod deployment for capturing traffic.

The second combines our "webby" container with an "nginx" container. In subsequent labs, we'll include a 3rd container in this pod arrangement to augment our website with a blogging service.
