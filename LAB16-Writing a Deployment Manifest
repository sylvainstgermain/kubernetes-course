#Let's grab a manifest for us that is already written.

kubectl apply -f https://static.alta3.com/projects/k8s/zombie.yaml

kubectl get pods
NAME                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
zombie-75ddd4d4b4-959gv   1/1     Running   0          20s
zombie-75ddd4d4b4-khm55   1/1     Running   0          20s
zombie-75ddd4d4b4-pbt4p   1/1     Running   0          20s

kubectl delete pod zombie-75ddd4d4b4-pbt4p
kubectl get pods
NAME                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
zombie-75ddd4d4b4-959gv   1/1     Running   0          57s
zombie-75ddd4d4b4-b5f8g   1/1     Running   0          11s
zombie-75ddd4d4b4-khm55   1/1     Running   0          57s

kubectl delete -f https://static.alta3.com/projects/k8s/zombie.yaml
kubectl apply -f https://static.alta3.com/projects/k8s/zombie.yaml

Another way to delete a Deployment is to get a listing of the Deployments, then delete the Deployment by its name:

kubectl get deployment
NAME      DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
zombie    3         3         3            3           4m

kubectl delete deployment zombie
kubectl get pods

kubectl create -f https://static.alta3.com/projects/k8s/zombie.yaml

#DELETE WITH LABEL "Now, just delete the entire deployment like this:"
kubectl delete deploy -l app=nginx
