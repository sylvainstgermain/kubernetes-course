calico-kube-controllers - This service can be regarded as a helper container that bundles together the various components required for networking containers with Calico. The key components are: Felix, BIRD, and confd.
calico-node - This is the service on one of the 3 nodes doing networking for the pods. There are 3 nodes, so this appears 3 times.
coredns - This is the DNS service for the cluster. It is repeated twice because it is highly available.

CoreDNS is a single container per instance, vs kube-dns which uses three
Kube-dns uses dnsmasq for caching, which is single threaded C. CoreDNS is multi-threaded Go.
CoreDNS enables negative caching in the default deployment. Kube-dns does not.
CoreDNS is typically 3 to 4 times better at resolving external names (e.g. alta3.com), whereas kube-dns is a bit better at resolving internal names. This is likely due to dnsmasq being more optimized 
than CoreDNS's built-in caching.
