When the job initially runs, it spawns a pod name, then runs under that name,
 and then it dies. Sad but true! However it leaves its logs behind which you 
 can collect and examine. 
First you need to find the dead job's pod name as follows:

# 
PODS=$(kubectl get pods --selector=job-name=countdown --output=jsonpath={.items..metadata.name})

#Using the $PODS variable, print the logs to see the standard output.
kubectl logs $PODS

#Let's examine how that slick command (two steps back) worked. We'll dig a little
# deeper by selecting the first 10 lines of the jobs YAML
kubectl get pods --selector=job-name=countdown --output=yaml | grep -A10 ^apiVersion:

#Delete the job.
kubectl delete job countdown
